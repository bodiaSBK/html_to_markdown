Zahra Tondkar, Rose and Nightingale (detail), 2015 gouache, watercolour, 24-carat gold, 20 × 30 cm
This is a recreation of a Koran’s cover from the tenth century. Its original is held at the Malek National Museum in Tehran. All cracks, fractures, colour fading, and whatever that occurred in the original by the passage of time has been recreated carefully and intricately. Finally, the surface of work has been covered by a combination of lacquer and fixative.
