One of New Zealand's most interesting jewellers, Sarah Read has created a performance practice which explores the value of labour. In this project, she is stringing the polystyrene beads from a bean bag into an epic necklace form. It's the kind of challenge you might imagine South Koreans like [Yujin Eugénie Moon](http://garlandmag.com/article/the-art-of-polishing-stones/) would appreciate. As automation removes our dependence on human labour, might we see its re-emergence in artistic forms like this?
