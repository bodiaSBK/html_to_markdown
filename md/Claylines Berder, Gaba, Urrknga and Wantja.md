The Remote Communities Ceramics Network has been active for at least a decade providing exchange between Aboriginal clay artists across northern Australia. The latest results of this network can be seen in a new exhibition at Nishi Gallery in Canberra.
 _Berder. Gaba. Urrknga. Wantja._ presents new ceramics from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islands artists living in remote areas across Australia. The exhibition represents a north to south journey across the land; from Darnley Island in the most north-eastern part of Torres Strait Islands (Erub Arts), to Cardwell in Queensland (Girringun Aboriginal Art Centre), to Ntaria in Northern Territory (Hermannsburg Potters), to the Musgrave Ranges in the far north-west of South Australia (Ernabella Arts). Together, these four art centres make up the _Remote Communities Ceramic Network_. 
The title of the exhibition describes the closest word for "clay" from each art centre. _Berder_ is a Meriam (Torres Straits Islands) word for "mud". _Gaba_ is a Girramay, Jirrbal and Gulnay (Queensland) word for "white clay"; one of four ochre colours used to paint traditional objects. _Urrknga_ is a Western Aranda (Northern Territory) word for "clay or dirty mud". _Wantja_ is a Pitjantjatjara (South Australia) word for "the hard, moist earth; the first sign of water when digging a soakage well". 
_Berder. Gaba. Urrknga. Wantja._ depicts a kaleidoscopic range of narratives. The objects from Girringun depict the mystical spirit of fire. 
Exhibition supported by the Indigenous Languages and Arts (ILA) program Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program The Australian National University, School of Art and Design Arts Queensland

 **[Girringun Aboriginal Art Centre (QLD)](http://art.girringun.com.au) ** The Girringun Aboriginal Art Centre represents artists from the Traditional Owner Groups of the Nywaigi, Gugu Badhun, Warrgamay, Warungnu, Bandjin, Girramay, Gulgnay, Jirrbal and Djiru people. Emerging from the rainforest canopy and cultures that have spanned generations, the stories and environments of these ancient cultures are transformed into visual designs by weavers, painters, potters, textile artists and makers of traditional objects. 
**[Hermannsburg Potters (NT)](http://hermannsburgpotters.com.au) ** The Hermannsburg Potters are a close group of Western Arrernte artists who have worked for the past 35 years in their community of Ntaria. Located in Hermannsburg, 130 kilometres west of Alice Springs, the hand-coiled terracotta pots of these artists are painted with vibrant depictions of their individual and shared histories in their country. Stories and events of the past and present interweave to present narratives characterised by adaptation, social shifts and the Arrernte artists' keenness to learn and work with the new.
