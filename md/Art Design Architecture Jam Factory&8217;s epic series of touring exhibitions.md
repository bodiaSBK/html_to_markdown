The _Art Design Architecture_ series sought to profile craftspersons, designers and artists who were using the language of a specific material in interesting ways. This continued Parkes ' curatorial approach to engage craft and design with industry where many opportunities for employment and commissions can be found. In the process, he highlights the skill and creativity of Australian designer-makers.
Garland's editor Kevin Murray had the opportunity to chat with Brian Parkes about what prompted this series and what he learned during their tours.
Here is the series of _Art Design Architecture_ exhibitions (thus far).
