At Garland, we love stories of string. Robyn McKenzie's essay on [string-figures](https://garlandmag.com/article/quarterly-essay-remembering-the-string-figures-of-yirrkala/) is particularly memorable. This rich article from a publication about coastal cultures includes the story of how perfectly preserved papyrus rope was discovered in a man-made cave in the ancient Egyptian harbour of Saww. String-lovers will enjoy this.
