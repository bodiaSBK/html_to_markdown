Our February Laurel goes to Sydney jeweller Bridget Kennedy, for a ring that reflects the tragedy that engulfs Australia in 2019-2020. The ring evokes the geometrical beauty of the beehive, while acknowledging the devastation wrought on the climate by use of fossil fuels.

Here is Bridget Kennedy's comment:
> So this is what I've been working on recently to help try and process what's been happening to our country and community of animals, plants and people….a development of work from my 2012 'in memory of bees' rings. This is part of a larger ongoing collection of memento mori pieces that look at the loss of insect biodiversity, value and our symbiotic relationship with Nature. Luckily our backyard garden native and honey bees seemed to have survived the recent hot weather (temperatures over 42 degrees can cause the wax inside hives to soften and melt and collapse on top of the queen killing her, and we recently hit 45.3 here in Sydney).
