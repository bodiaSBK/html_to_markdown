Our friend [Ana Berrio](http://garlandmag.com/article/geodenim-ornament-from-the-streets-of-medellin/) shares another remarkable project of Colombian street jewellery. For Joya Barcelona recently, she made a cart decorated in typical style and sold body ornaments made from chocolate for €10 each. Xocolatlummm included artists Titi Berrio, Alejandra Ferrer and Liliana Molina.
