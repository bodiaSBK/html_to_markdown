Dragon and phoenix wedding candles
Shaoheng Feng nominates the red candle as a key to the "craft of love" in Chinese culture.
### Poems of Red Candle
 
洞房昨夜停红烛，待晓堂前拜舅姑
妆罢低声问夫婿 画眉深浅入时无
In the bridal chamber last night stood red candles
Waiting for the morning to salute the father and mother in the hall
Asking my husband softly after putting on makeup
Does the eyebrow shade perfectly match my eyes
Qingshe Zhu
 
宝烛烟光吐，琼筵香气和
婚缘一线牵 鼓乐响堂前
The candlelight gave off a fascinating light
The candlelight can also bear witness to our everlasting love, just like carving an oath on a stone
Li Ying
 
三生石上主良缘 恩爱夫妻彩线牵
花烛洞房亲接吻 春宵一刻胜千金
参透烛光眉样好 百年有结是同心  
The candlelight can witness the moment of our wedding at the same time, and let us remember our vow to love each other deeply  
The light through the candles. I can see that my eyebrows are drawn just right  
At the same time, we make a vow that will be never changed, everlasting.
Shi Su from Song Dynasty

One of the most famous weddings in Chinese history featured third Emperor [Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_\(ruler\)), around 2,300 BC. His wedding was celebrated with great fireworks, filling the skies with smoke and bursts of light. Countless flocks of birds were seen to appear in witness to the event. In reference to this wedding, today young Chinese couples burn red candles on their wedding night. Red symbolises good luck and health, as well as eternal love.
