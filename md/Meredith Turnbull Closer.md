Meredith Turnbull developed a striking installation of objects from the collection of the Potter Museum of Art (27 March - 1 July 2018). [Closer](http://www.art-museum.unimelb.edu.au/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/exhib-date/2018-03-27/exhib/meredith-turnbull-closer) explored different possible proximities for the viewer with precious handmade objects. It demonstrated the powerful aesthetic potential of gathering together works across time on an open platform.
