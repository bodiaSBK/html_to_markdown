Shino ware
Gallery VOICE introduces some of the unique Japanese ceramic ware that is the fruit of the legendary Momoyama kiln in Toki City Gifu prefecture.
The _Motoyashiki_ kiln site is composed of four kilns. One of them is _Renboshiki Noborigama_ (linked multi-chamber climbing kiln) and the others are _Oh-gama_ (single-chamber kiln). Most importantly, the _Renboshiki Noborigama_ is the oldest of the kilns in the Mino region and famous as the birthplace of _Oribe_ ware. The original kiln structure is well preserved. Because of its importance in the development of Japanese ceramics, it was designated a National Historical Monument in 1967. Here, your experience of walking around the _Motoyashiki_ kiln site will allow you to deepen your understanding of _Oribe_ ware and the other wares fired in _Oh-gama_ ( _Setoguro, Kiseto, Shino_ ) as you enjoy yourself in [_Oribenosato_ Park.](http://www.toki-bunka.or.jp/oribe)

###  **Mino-Momoyama Ware**
During the Momoyama period (sixteenth to seventeenth century), as tea ceremony grew in popularity, Mino ware reflected the taste of tea masters. The ceramic ware of this style made in that period is called _Mino-Momoyama_ ware, of which there are four kinds: _Setoguro_ type _, Kiseto_ type _, Shino_ type and _Oribe_ type.
 _Setoguro_ , _Kiseto,_ and _Shino_ appeared in the early Momoyama period and they were generated in _Oh-gama_ ．[ _Setoguro_](https://garlandmag.com/loop/setoguro/)type, means black _seto_ glaze was a special variety of iron glaze．When the tea-bowl with iron graze glowed red in the chamber, it was pulled out of the kiln at peak temperature and cooled rapidly so their color turned to black．The original colour of iron glaze is brown，but this special skill changes the ware dramatically．In the _Kiseto_ type，yellow _seto_ glaze is decorated with ash glaze．Ash was made from plants．While th _Setoguro_ type was used only for tea-bowls， _Kiseto_ type was associated with tea-ceremony party’s table ware, such as dish，bowl，and vase．Next， _Shino_ type with the new white glaze appeared．This was the first white glaze in Japan，and also the initial ceramics decorated by the writing brush．There had been no drawn ceramics in Japan until _Shino_ came out．

 _The Oribe_ Type _Motoyasiki_ kiln site was the first _Renboshiki Noborigama_ (linked multi-chamber kiln) introduced to Mino from _Karatsu_ （modern Saga prefecture Japan） in the beginning of the seventeenth century．It has 14 chambers and measures more than 24 meters long．This kiln had stronger heating power than the former kiln _Oh-gama_ ．So the Mino potter came to mass-produce ceramics because of this kiln．The ceramics made in this kiln at the Momoyama period was _Oribe_ type．There were many kinds of _Oribe_ type ware produced in _Motoyasik_ i- kiln，for example， _Ao_ _oribe_ ， _Shino_ _oribe_ ， _Aka_ _oribe_ ， _Narumi_ _oribe_ ， _Kuro_ _oribe_ ，and _Oribe_ _kuro_ ．
 _Ao_ _oribe_ is quite popular. The name _Oribe_ is associated in many people with this green ceramics covered with copper glaze. _Shino oribe_ is a sort of _Shino_ type fired in the linked multi-chamber kiln．These two ceramics are similar in their form and the colour，but totally different in their tastes．Some people find _Shino_ warm or soft，and feel _Shino oribe_ is cool or hard. _Aka oribe_ is made of red clay which contains elements of iron．And _Narumi oribe_ is a version of _Aka_ _oribe_ covered with the green glaze． _Kuro_ _oribe_ and _Oribe_ _kuro_ are made by same way of _Setoguro_ ．The difference between them is the white form of the body called in Japanese “ _Mado_ ”, which means the window． _Kuro_ _oribe_ has this white form，but _Oribe_ kuro has no space．Of course they are different from _Setoguro_ due to their warp．In generall, we take these ceramics as “ _Oribe_ ”
