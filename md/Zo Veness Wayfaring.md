As our September Laurel, Zoë Veness applies the most delicate of muslin textile to hard metal and produces a texture of trails that weaves a landscape in brass.
> In wayfaring one follows a path that one has previously travelled in the company of others, or in their footsteps, reconstructing the itinerary as one goes along. Only upon reaching his destination, in this case, can the traveller truly be said to have found his way (Ingold, 2016: 77).

This series of containers marks the first stage of my investigations for _Wayfaring_ , an exhibition project planned for 2021 in Hobart with three other artists; Sarah Stubbs, Sara Lindsay and Bella Dower. Iterative methods and seriality provide opportunities for nuance in surface detail to arise, with a process-led approach or the "way" the primary focus. Informing the making of these containers and the project more broadly are ideas about travelling through and inhabiting places by British anthropologist Tim Ingold who describes wayfaring as an "embodied experience of […] perambulatory movement" (2011: 148).

To create the work, sections of muslin fabric, selected for its loose weave, were first imprinted on to brass, copper and sterling silver using a rolling mill. Following this process, the metal was stippled with a steel punch, then formed into cylinders and silver soldered along the joins. Once all the edges were filed and sanded, the containers were coloured with my torch flame or dipped in a chemical solution to blacken.

The series was made in my workshop at Jervis Bay, three hours south of Sydney, in the heat of this year’s summer months against a backdrop of scribbly gums and banksias. They build on ideas from a previous body of work made in Hobart in 2017 titled _New Terrain in an Old World_ which was inspired by the alpine landscapes of kunanyi/Mount Wellington. In _Wayfaring_ these two worlds interweave with memories of pink dolerite vistas overlaid by views through my window of scribbly gum forests.
