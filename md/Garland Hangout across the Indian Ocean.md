Join contributors to the [Kaya](https://garlandmag.com/issue-10/) issue of Garland to reflect on the questions raised by their articles. 
The cultures of the Indian Ocean bring with them ancient traditions that seem at odds with contemporary urban life. Is it inevitable that those traditions will inevitably disappear? How might they evolve to be relevant today?
Many people in the South are removed from the "homeland" of their cultures. How do they stay connected to their "origin" while at the same time embracing the place where they now live?
