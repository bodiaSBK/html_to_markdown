Arab cultures have come to prominence recently mostly through the miraculous rise of the Gulf mega-cities, such as Dubai. These seem like ultra-modern spaces detached from their otherwise arid and hostile environment. But clearly, these cultures have a rich material history which can form the basis for a more grounded future. A new volume offers a space to think further about this.
Editors: Dr Qassim Saad and Dr Tony Fry
The book title: Design and Eastern Arab Countries: Its Past, Present & Future
The aim of this book is to provide a clear overview of the region that stimulates debate, gives direction to the development of design education, and provides an agenda that would strategically inform practitioners.
Respondents to the Expression of Interest are invited to propose a topic for a 5,000-word essay in one of the three parts of the book.
Part 1. Looking back on the history of design: tradition, colonialism and modernity. The topics invited would all critically reflect upon the relation between the place of design and the pre-modern, modern and contemporary history of the region.
Part 2. An evaluation of 'the now': what is the present picture of design practices and education in the region? This question is posed against the backdrop of conflict, political instability, economic circumstances, and socio-cultural problems and possibilities.
Part 3. Futuring the Region: How can design education, knowledge and practices contribute to the repair and transformation of the region so that it is better able to meet its challenges and constitute a viable and equitable future for all the societies of the region.
