We're excited to herald an important new event in our orbit of craft and design in the Indo-Pacific. The first[ Indian Ceramics Triennale](https://indianceramicstriennale.com/): _Breaking Ground_ is open in Jaipur from 31 August to 18 November 2018.
 _Breaking Ground_ has been conceived and driven by a six-member core team of mid-career ceramic artists – Anjani Khanna, Madhvi Subrahmanian, Neha Kudchadkar, Sharbani Das Gupta, Reyaz Badaruddin  & Vineet Kacker. It responds to the expansion in ceramic art in India and abroad and the idea of representing ceramics in a broader contemporary context. The artist projects for this edition explore themes of scale, site specificity and/or concept through installation, interaction, technology and performance. It is presented by Jawahar Kala Kendra in collaboration with the Contemporary Clay Foundation.
