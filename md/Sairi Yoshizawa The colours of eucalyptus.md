Sairi Yoshizawa's recent award-winning work applies a particularly Japanese approach to Australian nature, revealing the rustic beauty of eucalyptus.
Sairi’s work reflects her interest in the eternal discovery of colours in landscapes.
Her three eucalyptus bark dyed works are first woven with pre-mordant dyed threads. The work is first plain woven fabric however after the fabric is dipped/dyed in one bath the monotonous landscape appears; it is like searching for and recording nuance of colours and patterns in the landscape. The four eucalyptus leaves woven work are all woven with pre-hand natural dyed threads. The work took roughly four months to complete, not every day as she has been working on other projects. Many of her works are works on progress. There was a time gap between completing the bark-dyed and leaf-dyed works. She combined the works together to give more conceptual value by exploring the common grounds of belonging. The material absorbs the substance of everyday life. It explores the inner surface of truth through unique and unpredictable colours of the environment.
