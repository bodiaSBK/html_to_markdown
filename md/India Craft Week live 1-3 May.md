Garland supports Craft Village in its India Craft Week online forum 1-3 May 2020, covering the breadth of the nation's impressive crafts.
COVID-19 has an extraordinary global impact. Like any other sector, World Crafts has been also affected badly. Such extraordinary times require innovative solutions and a new interface to bring everyone together, and create a feel-good factor with hope and optimism, especially when the world is under lock-down due to pandemic. In order to begin the dialogue amongst various stakeholders, the Craft Village, a young member of World Craft Council - APR, is back with [India’s Official Craft Week](https://www.indiacraftweek.com/), but this time in its new avatar of Global Preview (Digital) in partnership with **British Council, India and Garland Magazine, Australia.**
