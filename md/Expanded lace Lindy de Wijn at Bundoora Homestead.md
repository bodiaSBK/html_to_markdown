In an era of "expanded" art, we now find different textile crafts going beyond the traditional domestic setting to find a place in the outside world. 
The latest instalment is provided by Lindy De Wijn, who is transforming the exterior of [Bundoora Homestead](http://www.bundoorahomestead.com/exhibition/lindy-de-wijn-connection/) with large-scale rope creations that combine traditional and contemporary lace making techniques. The work consists of three panels:
 _Panel 1 Waves of Iron and glass_ The forms of this panel are inspired from the waves and curves found in the stained glass windows of the Homestead crafted by Augustine Fischer as well as the iron work of the external balustrades.
 _Panel 2 Soft Hearts and Iron_ The central panel references the ornate heart features and curves seen on the iron balustrades externally and the pyrographic features of the internal stairs. The heart also symbolises the rich history of the Homestead. The memories of those who passed through this space, the rich history of love, loss, loneliness and discovery and the many dreams and spirits that have woven the story of the Homestead so far.
 _Panel 3 Rooftop flowers of S Milson of North Fitzroy_ The pattern seen in this panel is inspired by the moulded plaster ceiling of the upstairs gallery.
Lindy is a member of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Lace Guild. She collaborated with other members on demonstrating the making of lace gum leaves. She is recognised for combining her skills as an occupational therapist and her arts practice. Her current projects involve introducing contemporary lace works into the public realm and bringing lace "beyond the doily".
