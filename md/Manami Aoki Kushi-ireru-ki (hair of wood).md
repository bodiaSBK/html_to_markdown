Manami Aoki, Kushi-ireru-ki, 2019, Japanese cypress, H335 x W100 x D3mm
Our laurel for March 2019 goes to emerging Tokyo jeweller Manami Aoki.
Her first solo [exhibition](https://holeinthewall.tokyo/exhibition/kurashitosoushingu/) at Hiko Mizuno Jewelry College featured poignant works the imbued humble objects and materials with a life spirit. As Manami Aoki writes for this exhibition, "I live with jewellery. It means that I constantly consider how to wear objects found in my everyday life."
 _Kushi-_ ireru _-ki_ means  "wood that can be combed" or "hair of wood". This work took about a week to fiberise the piece of cedar. "I hammered it little by little and I proceeded a certain length per day in order to maintain focus."
