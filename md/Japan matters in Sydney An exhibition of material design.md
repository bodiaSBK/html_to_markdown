[Bic Tieu](http://www.bictieu.com/) learnt lacquer in Japan and has applied her knowledge to create exquisite objects which reflect her journey from Vietnam to Australia. 
For a recent exhibition, Bic Tieu has looked to other designers that make objects influence by Japanese techniques and materials. Shifts in Japanese Materiality is an exhibition of contemporary works by experimental Japanese and Australian designers, curated by Tieu at Sydney's[ Japan Foundation Gallery](http://www.jpf.org.au), February 2 – March 17, 2018
According to Tieu, "Japan’s artisan world remained largely unchanged for centuries by maintaining a rigid tradition that prescribes materials and creative processes. However, cross-cultural influences and dialogues have given Japan’s object-making culture a new transnational identity in contemporary experimental design."
