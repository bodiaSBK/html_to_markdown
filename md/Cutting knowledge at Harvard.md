This video offers a preview of "cutting" as a way of understanding how we make a world, deconstructing our philosophical concepts into material processes. This reflects many of the Garland articles that see culture as a manual phenomenon, such as Lisa Hilli's latest essay on [Embodied history](http://garlandmag.com/article/embodied-history/).
