The [Philosophy Pop-Up Shop](http://www.kingsartistrun.org.au/program/the-philosophy-pop-up-shop/) applies the creativity of consumerism to the genius of thinkers from Heidegger to Bruno Latour. In case you are worried about the lack of finish in some of the objects, "The Pop-Up Shop’s in-house designer is Plato, whose rough-and-ready style proves that ideas are more important than appearances."
