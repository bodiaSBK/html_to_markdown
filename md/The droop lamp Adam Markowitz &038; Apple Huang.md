Our April laurel goes to Adam Markowitz and Apple Huang for their Droop Lamp, which reveals new possibilities of beauty from the waste that is our industrial legacy. 
The components are recycled HDPE plastic (primarily sourced from milk bottles, shampoo bottles & hand soap), brass, recycled timber (old rafters). Most lighting components are cannibalised from second-hand lamps. The milk bottles provide translucency while the shampoo bottles offer vibrant colours as decoration. As they [write](http://solar.friendsand.associates/recycled-hdpe-plastic-primarily-sourced-from-milk-bottles-shampoo-bottles-and-hand-soap-brass-recycled-timber-old-rafters-most-lighting-components-cannibalised-from-2nd-hand-lamp), "Given we're stuck with this waste material for the next thousand odd years, we might as well see what it can do."
Here's a more detailed view that the reveals the fine work that transforms these "crude" materials.

As Damien Wright observes:
> Honouring both the unique gift and grace of the human hand and the interest of contemporary design in new extractive and processing frontiers. The wee lamp celebrates the disaster of design and marketing, its consume at all cost ideology and its environmental and human sacrifice. Recasting vanity plastics into a playful jellyfish shade. Soft, magnetic, possibly poisonous and full of life. Grounded to our earth by an ebonised teardrop base of salvaged eucalyptus reganius timber. An anchor whose surface proudly shows the skill and material knowledge of the human that made it. Its hardwood surface is delicately scalloped. It is beautiful, intelligent and without a hint false irony or hypocrisy. Our future is handmade.
