     Tomonari Kat0, Topological Formation 2017-1 Ishoken gallery vol.06
  

Ishoken (Tajimi City Pottery Design and Technical Center), established in October 1959, is the institution transferring from the Minoyaki Overglaze and Enamel Decoration Research Center. Since March 1960, when the first graduating class finished the Ishoken training program, more than 850 young talents have graduated to become active as ceramists or designers.
In May 2016, Ishoken opened the [ishoken gallery](http://www.city.tajimi.lg.jp/ishoken/index.html) in the main building, in order to introduce the young graduates of Ishoken who are doing excellent jobs, and to make new opportunities for the students who are currently enrolled in.
Last year, we had three exhibitions: _vol.01, Akio Niisato_ , _vol.02, Keita Matsunaga_ and _vol.03, Masato Komai_. We’ve already had two exhibitions this year: _vol.04 Takuro Kuwata_ and _vol.05 Jun Matsumura_. We will have the next exhibition, _vol.06 Tomonari Kato_ from 9th February 2018 to 11th March 2018.
Mr. Kato Tomonari received the Gold Award in the 11th International Ceramics Competition Mino this year. He graduated Ishoken in 1996. Currently, he runs a pottery manufacture in Tajimi city, while carrying on his own creative activities.
At the same time as the Kato Tomonari’s exhibition, we will hold two other exhibitions.
One is the Graduation Show 2018 held at Ceramic Park MINO. A dozen of second year students (both from the Design course and the Craft course) and four students of the Ceramics Lab course will display a variety of works from tableware to objects. The exhibition will be held from 16th February to 18th February, 2018.
The other one is the Exhibition for the Promotion 2018 held at the Ishoken gallery. fifteen first-year students (Design course and Craft course) will display Meshiwan (rice bowls). They will examine the many facets of “Meshiwan” and approach them from different angles. The exhibition starts from 9th February, continues till 11th March, 2018.
