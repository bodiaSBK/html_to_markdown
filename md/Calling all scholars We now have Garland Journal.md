We're proud to announce the beginning of our peer-review section of Garland that will feature thoughtful writing from academics from across the Indo-Pacific. 
Currently, there is no academic publication that provides a platform for research about creative practice across the Indo-Pacific. This is a dynamic region with many new universities and art schools offering pathways to formalise their creative sectors.
The peer review section of the quarterly will include academic articles that make an original contribution to the archive of knowledge about creative practice in the material arts. The material arts includes object-based practices such as craft, product design and representational practices such as painting, photography, video and performance that take a concrete form in the world. We welcome submissions arising from postgraduate theses. 
You can find out more about the journal and its submission requirements on the[ Journal](http://garlandmag.com/journal) page. 
This initiative is supported by the RMIT University School of Art.
