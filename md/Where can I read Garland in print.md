Where do you go to read?
If you want to take 20 minutes out to follow the journey of a long-form essay, where can you find a convivial space to sit and read? Talking with Garland readers, we've found that the cafe is a popular place to take time out for reading during the day. So to help you out we're finding independent cafes across the Indo-Pacific which have a bookshelf and a convivial atmosphere, reflecting the care and creativity of the staff.
We'll be gradually accumulating these [reading posts](https://garlandmag.com/reading-posts/) over time. Feel free to [nominate](https://garlandmag.com/about/contact/) your favourite cafe.
We've just created our second reading post at Choukette Cafe in Brunswick, Melbourne. You can see a full list [here](https://garlandmag.com/reading-posts/).
