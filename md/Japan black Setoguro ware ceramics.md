Tomoko Kawakami writes about the exhibition, _Kirin-ji: The challenge of making ceremonial tea bowls_
In January 2020, the Gallery Voice will hold an exhibition titled “The Present Situation of Ceramic Art—"Kirin-ji” Who Undertook the Challenge of Making Ceremonial Tea Bowls”.
The word “Kirin-ji” means a child of Kirin, the Chinese divine beast which is traditionally regarded as capable to bless people with a child prodigy, highly talented and carrying promising prospects.
In the Azuchi-momoyama period (1573 to 1603 A.D), ceremonial tea bowls were made in Mino district (mainly today’s Toki-city, Tajimi-city, Mizunami-city, and Kani-city), and the tea bowls made here remain popular not only as tea ceremony instruments, but also as artworks.
This exhibition will feature tea bowls made by young artists studying ceramics at the Tajimi City Pottery Design and Technical Center as well as by experienced ceramic artists. Every artist has tried in a unique way to create an individual style of tea bowl with an unorthodox idea as well as a respect for history.

Kozo Kato (Holder of Important Intangible Cultural Property) Born in 1935. Mr Kozo Kato studied under Toyozo Arakawa, Holder of Important Intangible Cultural Property concerning Shino ware. He started from studying the works of his master, and developed his own style.
Designated as a holder of Important Intangible Cultural Property concerning the technique of Setoguro ware in 2010, he is energetically continuing creative activities. “Setoguro” means black-Seto type tea bowl in Japanese, which is made with the technique of “hikidashi-guro”. This is a firing technique of taking out the work from the burning kiln and cooling it down quickly, which makes the glaze turn into expressive black colors.
