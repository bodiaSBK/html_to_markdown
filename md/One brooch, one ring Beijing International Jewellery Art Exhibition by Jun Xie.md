With the global rise of China comes its growing cultural and artistic influence. The recent international exhibition of art jewellery in Beijing is testament to their ambition. This could be a positive force for the region's craft and design communities.

I interviewed Yi Zhao who was one of the originators of the Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology team.
 _Jun Xie: How do you feel about this exhibition? What is your expectation for this exhibition? Do you think it’s succeed? Why?_
Yi Zhao: In the past six years, we have seen through the Chinese contemporary jeweller’s progress and their position changed on the international stage. Almost all friends have seen the past exhibition agreed that the designer level have been improved a lot in China. The exhibition itself did not lie, all these positive feedbacks reveal the real show. As initiator and practitioner of exhibition BIFT, we hope our audiences will be touch by the beauty of the Oriental and western beauty, and process the beauty in the heart.
 _Jun Xie: How do you think about the current statue of contemporary jewellery in China? Can you understand what the artists try to say? How do you feel about the future of contemporary in China?_
Yi Zhao: I think that Chinese contemporary jewellery is not specific kind of art style, but a way of thinking. They themselves are the epitome of our community and society. I believe that a few years later, there will be greater public realisation of the value and significance of contemporary jewellery, therefore they will pay more attention and give more respect.
