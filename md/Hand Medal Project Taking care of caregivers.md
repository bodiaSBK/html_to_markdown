Garland actively supports the Hand Medal Project, which bestows caregivers with handmade metal tokens of respect and gratitude.
The [Hand Medal Project](https://handmedalproject.com/en/index.html) is a collective effort to acknowledge the work of front-line caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individual jewellery makers are invited to make small metal hands which are sent to a Hand Keeper who then gives them to a Hand-Giver associated with caregiving, who bestows them on individual health workers as a collective recognition of their dedication.
As the organisers write:
> While we are all watching caregivers, nurses, and doctors giving all they can to our communities, risking their lives for us, we want to find a way to honor them. They should all get a medal, a votive offering given in gratitude or devotion. At some point, this crisis will end and there will be a moment when we can thank them for all they do. We propose to present as many health workers as we can with a medal based on a traditional ex-voto, also to mark the moment when we can see a future.⁣
Jewellers can register [here](https://handmedalproject.com/en/index.html) to participate. For project background, see [Art Jewelry Forum.](https://artjewelryforum.org/in-your-hands)
