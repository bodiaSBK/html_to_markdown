In this issue, we introduce a unique exhibition titled "A Shape of YOI", which has already started in April 2019.
YOI" is written in Japanese as "よい". This word has many homonyms. For example, it means "good" or "evening" when written in different characters. Or with another character, it has another meaning as “getting drunk” or “motion sickness”.
The uniqueness of this exhibition comes from the theme of the exhibition, “YOI”, a word with various meanings that allows the artists to have various interpretations.Here, we present some exhibitors' images from this exhibition. In this exhibition, 408 artists have exhibited. Most of the exhibits are ceramic works, but there are also lacquer works, glass, metal and textile works.
