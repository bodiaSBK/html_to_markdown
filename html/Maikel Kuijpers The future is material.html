His book, An <em>Archaeology of Skill</em> (2017), argues that to understand objects of the bronze age, we need to account for the experience of the metalsmith in dialogue with materials.</p><p>We cover in particular the video Kuijpers produced in Cambridge, <em>The Future is Handmade</em>, which advocated for the renewed value of craft in trades. Why would an archeologist make a film about a contemporary tailor?</p><p>Maikel Kuijpers is Assistant Professor of the Archaeology of Early Europe at Leiden University as well as a research coordinator for the Centre of Global Heritage and Development, a collaboration between Technical University Delft, Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Leiden University.</p><p><em>The image above is from the <a href="https://theuniversaldeclarationofmaterialrights.org/">Declaration of Material Rights</a> coordinated by Dutch architect Thomas Rau. </em></p><hr /><p><iframe src="https://anchor.fm/garland/embed/episodes/Maikel-Kuijpers-on-material-thinking-and-the-Future-is-Handmade-efh88m" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><hr /><div class="epyt-video-wrapper"><iframe id="_ytid_15289" data-orig data-orig data-relstop="1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jOMujtoicTk?enablejsapi=1&#038;autoplay=0&#038;cc_load_policy=0&#038;cc_lang_pref=&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;loop=0&#038;modestbranding=0&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;playsinline=0&#038;autohide=2&#038;theme=dark&#038;color=red&#038;controls=1&#038;" class="__youtube_prefs__ epyt-is-override no-lazyload" title="YouTube player" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen data-no-lazy="1" data-skipgform_ajax_framebjll=""></iframe></div>
