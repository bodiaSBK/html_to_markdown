Jenna Lee&#8217;s <a href="https://jm-lee.myportfolio.com/memorise">Memorise</a> series shows how the process of folding can have strong symbolic meaning. It begins with an Instagram challenge&#8230;</p><p><em> Can you say how the idea of this work came about?</em></p><p>I had wanted to explore the theme of memory for quite some time. I have always had an incredible memory, often surprising my mum about things I remember about childhood. Personally, there are a few memories that are incredibly strong. Just before making this work one memory, in particular, played back in a dream. It just so happened that there is an Instagram bookbinding community challenge called<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/areyoubookenough/"> #areyoubookenough</a> and that month&#8217;s theme to explore was Memory. So a few things aligned to spur on making this work.</p><p><em> Why did you choose this specific material?</em></p><p>Paper for me is a bit of an obsession, I tend to collect/hoard paper that I am drawn to. It’s usually more about texture and weight than colour, but this pale blue really drew me in. It has an &#8220;archival&#8221; quality I was wanting to explore in relation to memory. I use tracing paper a lot in my text-based works to transfer the words. However, I always keep the pieces after as there is something about the hazy transparency that I find so intriguing. Each of the papers possessed a quality that I wanted to link with the concept of memory and remembering.</p><p><em> How did you choose the particular folds?</em></p><p>For this series of books I was experimenting with a &#8220;meditative&#8221; process, I focussed on the particular memory that replayed as a dream and then let the paper inform the folds. Each piece had subtle material differences with which ended up informing the fold much more than I had expected.</p><p><em> How is the work displayed? Can visitors open the &#8220;books&#8221;?</em></p><p>As of now, nobody else has come into contact with the books. If the books ever get installed in a show I am really not sure about being able to open them. I think if I feel at the time that other people opening the books will add to the books meaning then I will. But for now I am happy to have only me handle them &#8211; the more I think about them, the more intimate and personal they are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/JennaLee_Studio_04.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14759" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/JennaLee_Studio_04-1024x576.jpg" /></a><p style="padding-left: 40px;">My name is Jenna Lee. I am a proud mixed race Larrakia, Wardaman and Karajarri woman whose contemporary art practice explores themes of identity/identification, label/labelling and the relationships between language and object. As a Queer, Mixed Race, Asian, Aboriginal Woman all of my work includes themes of feminism, gender, sexuality, race, Aboriginality and the constant and exhausting process of identifying in a society that demands it (read <a href="https://jm-lee.myportfolio.com/about">more</a>).</p><p>You can also hear Jenna Lee talking about her process of papermaking on ABC Radio National <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/awaye/larrakia-artist-jenna-lee/11165106">Awaye</a>.</p>
