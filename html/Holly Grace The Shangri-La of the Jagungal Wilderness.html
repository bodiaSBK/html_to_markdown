Her latest show at Sabbia introduces a theatrical background giving expression to the historical context that underpins her work.</p><p>She writes:</p><p>These three billycans are from Wheelers Hut otherwise known as the Shangri-La of the Jagungal Wilderness. Built around 1903-04 by William Wheeler also know as “One-Arm-Will or Wingy Wheeler”. Wingy as his name suggests lost one arm in childhood but this amputation was not known to hamper him in anyway. He was often seen riding his horse rounding up brumbies whilst smoking his cigar and cracking two stock whips at the same time—I think this might be an exaggeration.</p><p>This is one of the mountain’s most picturesque huts, particularly its location overlooking Mt Jagungal, the Tooma River and the Jagungal Wilderness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hut.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15184" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/hut.jpg" /></a><div id="attachment_15185" style="width: 672px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wheeler.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15185" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15185 size-full" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/wheeler.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15185" class="wp-caption-text">Holly Grace, Wingy Wheeler, 2019 blown glass with sandblasted imagery and painted enamelled surfaces 165 h x 210 w x 150mm d; Wheelers Hut, 2019 blown glass with sandblasted imagery and painted enamelled surfaces 205 h x 220 w x 190mm d</p></div><p><em>Holly Grace </em>Allegory of the Landscape<em> is at Sabbia Galleries Sydney 24 July to 17 August 2019</em></p>
