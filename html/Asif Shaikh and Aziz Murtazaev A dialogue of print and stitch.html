Asif relished the challenge of ikat: &#8220;I love the boldness of the Ikat, my hand embroidery is very fine. I have design outfits keeping two country&#8217;s traditions in mind. Ikat has its own motifs and patterns. I have created motifs from the ikat pattern for embroidery, which compliments the ikat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20275" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20200711_171242-768x1024.jpg" /><p>Aziz Murtazaev has an ikat workshop in Margilan, Fergana vallery, Uzbekistan (<a href="https://garlandmag.com/article/aziz-murtazaev/">story here</a>). This ikat pattern was based on the traditional &#8220;Khoshiya gul&#8221; design. The natural dyes included madder roots, pomegranate, walnut shell and indigo. Aziz designed this ikat with the intention for further collaboration with embroidery or/and block-printing master.</p><p>According to Aziz, &#8220;It was woven right before the Kokand festival. When Asif came up with the idea of collaboration natural dyed ikats with his fine embroidery. This was good fortune.&#8221;</p><p>Congratulations to both, on a wonderful collaboration of culture, creativity and craft.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20276" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OMG1953-1024x683.jpg" /><p>&nbsp;</p>
