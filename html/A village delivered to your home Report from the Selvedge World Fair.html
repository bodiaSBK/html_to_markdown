I felt it demonstrated what can be managed with readily available technology.</p><p>Due to COVID-19, this celebration of cloth, culture and creativity went virtual from 3 – 5 September 2020. It was originally planned as an &#8220;in-person&#8221; event to be hosted in London.</p><p>Funds were raised to stage the event through a crowdfunding website. Online workshops were held. Chatrooms were scheduled with artisans ‘chatting’ similar to text messaging. Talks on Zoom involved people from multiple countries &#8211; ‘I think you’re on mute’ was heard many times. And an online market brought artisan products to new markets.</p><p>So, does an online workshop actually work? Yes. I attended a workshop on Nagaland decorative stitching. The stitching techniques were demonstrated by Rokozeno Chaya in Nagaland (India). It was facilitated by Radhi Parekh in Mumbai representing the &#8220;<a href="https://artisanscentre.com/">ARTISANS x Leshemi Origins</a>&#8221; Nagaland project. Natasha was hosting from the UK and twelve people participated from five countries. Beforehand we received a video about Nagaland’s nettle cloth, a handout with stitching instructions and a materials pack, so I could handle the handwoven nettle cloth of Nagaland. Questions were via the &#8220;chat&#8221; function on Zoom. Rokozeno and Radhi told us stories and showed us traditional textiles. Finally, the video recording was emailed to us afterwards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20050" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/NagaWorkshop-1024x576.jpg" /><p>I missed having a teacher look over my shoulder but the camera was close up on the instructor’s work as she spoke.</p><p>Can technology offer a unique experience? Yes. It did through Slow TV in the form of a two-day live feed from Bhujodi weaving village, Gujarat. This was a &#8220;fly on the wall&#8221; experience of the activities of weavers and dyers in Shamji Vankar Vishram Valji’s weaving complex. Having visited this village last year before COVID, I can verify that the virtual experience was almost like being there. I could hear the local birdlife, the kids playing and the sounds of weavers beating the weft yarn, all through my television. It was a strangely soothing experience.</p><p>I felt this experience showcased how living traditions in cloth-making can come alive to us in new ways.</p>
