Many of us live with it ubiquitous brands, including Samsung, the world&#8217;s most popular smartphone, LG and Hyundai.  And now the exuberant k-pop is topping the US charts with BTS.</p><p>South Korea has undergone a rapid ascension since 1953 when it was one of the <a href="http://www.mybusiness.com/south-korea-from-one-of-the-poorest-countries-in-the-world-to-one-of-the-richest-in-20-years/">world&#8217;s poorest countries</a>. But the nation is remarkable not only for its stellar industrialisation. South Korea still retains one of the world&#8217;s most refined craft traditions.</p><p><a href="http://www.handyarty.co.kr">Handmade Korea</a> is a craft fair that serves the growing demand to keep making things, even when robots have taken over the factories.</p><p>Handmade Korea is located in the COEX centre in downtown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_District">Gangnam</a>. This year&#8217;s event coincided with an extraordinary heat wave. Temperatures topped 37 degrees and on the street, it was like walking through butter. Most pedestrians juggled their large smartphones with handheld battery-powered fans.</p><p>I arrived there via the air-conditioned Starfield (<em>Byeolmadang</em>) Centre, the world&#8217;s largest underground mall. In the middle is <a href="http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/AKR/FU_EN_15.jsp?cid=2496079">Starfield Library</a>, an extraordinary monument to the book, consisting of 13m high shelves with 50,000 volumes, all for free public enjoyment. As a public service, it would seem excessive, but here it serves a testimony to the long-term benefit of Chaebol capitalism.</p><p>Handmade Korea covered a vast expanse of the exhibition hall. It included 820 booths featuring 650 exhibitors from 23 countries. Overall, this year&#8217;s event attracted 107,500 visitors. There was great activity around the booths and workshops providing craft supplies, especially sewing. I was curious to see a promotion of &#8220;Healing paper&#8221; for those who enjoy colouring—and interested to see that Sydney was the chosen subject for us to dream of. Textiles made with natural dyes were popular and of a high standard. The most successful booths seemed to have some kind of design element that creatively considered the needs of the user.</p><p>I was pleased to meet up with craftspersons from many other countries, such as Iran, Indonesia and India. But I fear that they hadn&#8217;t done sufficient marketing to frame their products for a foreign audience. This is particularly the case for Iran, even though they are innocent of the reasons for the latest US sanctions. As with Garland&#8217;s <a href="https://garlandmag.com/threads/the-persian-prospect-the-future-of-iranian-art-in-the-world/">Persian Prospect</a>, we all need to be reminded of the intense beauty that Iran contributes to the world. I hope next year that the foreign booths can be augmented by the story of their nation as well as the individual products.</p><p>Seoul&#8217;s <a href="http://www.handyarty.co.kr">Handmade Korea</a> sits alongside CICB as an event to attract the world&#8217;s craft makers and admirers. The enduring beauty of K-craft may be just as important, in the longer run, as the latest fleeting k-pop sensation.</p>
