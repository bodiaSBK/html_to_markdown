Then, Roudabeh drops her long and rope-like hair for Zal to make her free from prison. But Zal’s Iranian style of love and chastity prevents him touching and using her beloved hair as a rope. So he kisses her hair to show his respect and makes a rope by something else, not her hair, and finally saves Roudabeh from prison.</p><p>This story is one of the best and the most delicate Persian (Iranian) love stories.</p><p>Elements of this work include:</p><ul><li>The Lotus Flower is one of the most ancient flower shapes in Persian history</li><li>Roudabeh’s dress has been inspired by ancient Persian women’s costumes</li><li>Original Persian colours and stones such as turquoise and lazuli</li><li>The altars in two sides of the ring, associate the Iranian-Islamic art</li><li>The ring roof motif has been inspired by Iranian tiles and Iranian inner home decoration in which the inlaid tiles are used.</li><li>The ring is designed like a mansion with columns and piles in each floor that represent the ancient Iranian architecture.  </li></ul><p>In designing of this ring, the original source were two verses of Shahnameh composed by Ferdowsi:</p><blockquote><p>She made a rope by her long hair for her lover(Zal) to catch<br /> But Zal refused to use his beloved hair as a rope.</p></blockquote><p>Creators: Niloufar Mirshahidi &amp; Behnaz Barabarian</p>
