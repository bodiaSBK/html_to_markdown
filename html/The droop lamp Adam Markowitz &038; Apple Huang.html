Most lighting components are cannibalised from second-hand lamps. The milk bottles provide translucency while the shampoo bottles offer vibrant colours as decoration.

The wee lamp celebrates the disaster of design and marketing, its consume at all cost ideology and its environmental and human sacrifice. Recasting vanity plastics into a playful jellyfish shade. Soft, magnetic, possibly poisonous and full of life. Grounded to our earth by an ebonised teardrop base of salvaged eucalyptus reganius timber. An anchor whose surface proudly shows the skill and material knowledge of the human that made it. Its hardwood surface is delicately scalloped. It is beautiful, intelligent and without a hint false irony or hypocrisy. Our future is handmade. </p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.markowitzdesign.com/">Adam Markowitz</a> is a Designer/Maker of furniture &amp; lighting, practising architect and educator.
