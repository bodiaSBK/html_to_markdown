Talking with Garland readers, we&#8217;ve found that the cafe is a popular place to take time out for reading during the day. So to help you out we&#8217;re finding independent cafes across the Indo-Pacific which have a bookshelf and a convivial atmosphere, reflecting the care and creativity of the staff.</p><p>We&#8217;ll be gradually accumulating these <a href="https://garlandmag.com/reading-posts/">reading posts</a> over time. Feel free to <a href="https://garlandmag.com/about/contact/">nominate</a> your favourite cafe.</p><p>We&#8217;ve just created our second reading post at Choukette Cafe in Brunswick, Melbourne.
