Melissa Cameron&#8217;s new work, Marfa TX, turns this moment into singular jewellery.</p><p>My past is a foreign country. We do things differently t/here.</p><p>In 2017 I went on vacation to Marfa, TX, with Bruce and Elaine. It’s in the Chihuahuan desert; there, dropped steel has a long life on the ground. Seeing steel, and knowing I could geotag what I picked up using my phone’s camera, I started a solo scavenger hunt. It covered a campsite; a former US military base (now a part of the Chinati Foundation); the grounds of hotels, diners, galleries and museums; and the dusty streets and sidewalks of the town.</p><p>Marfa is in the Chihuahuan desert; there, dropped steel has a long life on the ground.

It was finally reopened in Perth. I printed the photos, matched and mapped the finds, researched, and drew. I used this data, and the found objects, to make jewellery.</p><p>Since childhood, I have picked up bits of metal from the ground. In Marfa, recording and collecting felt instinctive, inevitable. In Perth, I struggled to understand my compulsion at that time and in that place. I had to be with the collection and contextualize it, almost archeologically, in order to reimagine it.</p><p>Some finds have been altered significantly. Others minimally. All have travelled far. As have I.</p><p>Melissa Cameron, August 2019</p><div id="attachment_15324" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5843.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="30,18.2078N, 104,1.3138W" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15324" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15324 size-full" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_5843.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15324" class="wp-caption-text">30,18.2078N, 104,1.3138W.
