Al Munro* refers to it explicitly in the title of her show, which relates to the process of creating her patterned textiles, during which she literally translates digital to analogue and back again.</p><div id="attachment_15287" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Al-Munro_Pattern-Translation_Photo-Kate-Mathews.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Al Munro, Pattern Translation (painting and dress), 2018-19.

In his new body of work, Gilbert translates ideas from analogue (models and sketches) to digital (CAD rendering and component manufacture) and back to analogue (hand-making through the development of precision tooling).</p><div id="attachment_15288" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gilbert-Riedelbauch_Quad.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Gilbert Riedelbauch, Quad centre gloss red/black, 2019.

A rough translation.</p><p>In considering the ideas expressed through the group exhibition <i>Shifts in Japanese Materiality,</i> thoughtfully curated by Bic Tieu, I see this same sense of rough translation in the hand-rendering of various distinctions and commonalities between the cultures and aesthetics of Australia and Japan.</p><p>As someone who has worked directly with makers of many sorts since enrolling in an art school in Tasmania as a teenager, I am drawn to the rough (handmade) and to the refinement of the rough that is the mastery of a craft practice.</p><p>Perhaps the translation I’m seeing is a transformation <i>through</i> craft. The kind of thing the late, and much missed, Dr Robert Bell was referring to in his 2005 exhibition at the National Gallery of Australia, <i>Transformations: the language of craft</i>.</p><p>I like the idea that craft can be a universal intermediary language—making the foreign more familiar (whether it’s new technology or another culture). Rather than seeing things <i>lost</i> in translation, with craft—through the transformative skills of the maker—we more often see something <i>added</i> in translation.</p><p>In Kyoko Hashimoto’s reworking of the traditional Japanese form of Buddhist prayer beads or <i>Nenju</i> in <i>Shifts in Japanese Materiality</i> (in which the aggregate in the concrete beads is coloured plastic from her son’s discarded toys) we see a ubiquitous object (a string of beads) transformed into a poignant statement about the environmental impact of global trade and our, often unwitting, personal culpability (at least, that’s my rough translation).</p><div id="attachment_15290" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Kyoko-Hashimoto_Nenju-Necklace-1.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Kyoko Hashimoto, Nenju Neckpiece, 2018.

It includes a great essay by Dr Nicholas Bastin (who like the curator Bic Tieu, is also a maker) that does more justice to the works and the ideas expressed than I can in these few paragraphs.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to look at these three exhibitions together allows us to see contrasts and connections that make us think in ways that would be different if they were seen alone or in some other combination. Another clear connection I see across the works in these shows is an aesthetic one—there is, quite simply, a lot of beautiful work here!</p><p>I love that through craft, our many rich differences, whether political, social or cultural, can be roughly translated into things that inspire and unite us.</p><p>Brian Parkes, CEO JamFactory<br /> Adelaide, July 2019</p><p>*Al Munro is represented in Australia by May Space, Sydney</p><p>What: Shifts in Japanese Materiality, Pattern Translation and Form Follows Fold.</p><p>When: 11 July – 31 August 2019</p><p>Where: Craft ACT: Craft + Design Centre Gallery</p>
