The focus shifts to the traditional crafts itself, especially the positive effects of the culture and values behind it. As a result, the people who were invited to participate are no longer just artists and designers, the craftsperson has also become the subject of invited participators.</p><p>In addition, the event’s content has become diversified. Not only the unpopular traditional crafts become an independent theme of the event, but other types of activities related to “traditional crafts” are also emerging, such as “branding traditional crafts”, “recognizing traditional craftspersons”. The revival of traditional crafts also affects the transformation of the initiators of the events. Government institutions related to Intangible Cultural Heritage have begun to emerge and become the organisers of the event, and they not only cooperate with private institutions and organizations related to traditional crafts, but also with education institutions to bring academic resources and even commercial enterprises to bring financial resources to integrate all resources.</p><p>Therefore, crafts events are no longer simple activities inside the related industry, but a larger feast that the whole society can participate in. For foreign organisations related to craft, it is a great opportunity to collaborate with crafts events centred on culture and value behind traditional crafts and to establish new networks with emerging Chinese organisations related to the Intangible Cultural Heritage field.</p><hr /><p>Below is a list of the 75 national craft cities of China:</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 China
