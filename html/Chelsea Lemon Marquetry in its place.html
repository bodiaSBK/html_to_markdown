Chelsea developed her skills and creativity at the ANU School of Art Furniture Studio, followed by a residency at Sturt Craft. The Shinedome Tray is a wonderful example of how Canberra inspires a sense of place in its strong maker community.</p><p>Chelsea gives some background:</p><p>I originally created a series of trays for the Design Canberra festival, based on the architectural designs of Enrico Taglietti. I was then invited to create a new series &#8211; which I chose to depict buildings within Canberra which are iconic or are historically significant.</p><p>The outside of the trays is constructed with a coopering process, using Australian timber blackbutt. The image depicted internally is constructed by hand, using a technique known as parquetry and marquetry.</p><p>The coloured components are constructed with dyed veneers which are purchased from an Australian supplier. These colours are cut into different shapes and reconstructed to form an image.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chelsea-Lemon-Garland.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-14666" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chelsea-Lemon-Garland-835x1024.jpg" /></a>
