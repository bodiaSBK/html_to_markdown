<hr><p class="precede">For the upcoming Autumn Takayama Festival, Gallery VOICE is presenting work by six ceramic artists and the golden lacquer art called Shunkei.</p><h3>Furui Akiko</h3><p>When I create works, I am drawn by hands, eyes and my senses, that are more eloquent than I am conscious of. Both the movement of hands handling materials and the shape formed by building-up of clay are changing day by day. And by carefully looking at the changes in physical sensation, I have been changing my techniques and processes while searching for the shapes that I want to make. Not only images and aesthetic senses, but also my own physical sensation, ethics and all elements of me are closely related to the work.</p><div id="attachment_15350" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/①Hurui-Akiko-work01-2012.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Furui Akiko" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15350" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15350" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/①Hurui-Akiko-work01-2012.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15350" class="wp-caption-text">Furui Akiko</p></div><div id="attachment_15347" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/②Hurui-Akiko-work02-2016.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Furui Akiko" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15347" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15347" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/②Hurui-Akiko-work02-2016.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15347" class="wp-caption-text">Furui Akiko</p></div><p>My works are made by piling up strings with clay. I used to make works composed of aggregate of clay strings, but in the present works, the strings have become loose and soft, entangled freely to form their outer shapes. Currently I’m trying to create works that allow the clay to move more freely.</p><div id="attachment_15348" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/③Hurui-Akiko-work03-2019.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Furui Akiko" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15348" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15348" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/③Hurui-Akiko-work03-2019.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15348" class="wp-caption-text">Furui Akiko</p></div><h3>Ban Kazunori</h3><p>When I was a high school student, I learned pottery in Tokoname and went on to art university to learn more about manufacturing. An assignment in my third year of university triggered my approach to object wares.</p><p>While I was searching for the meaning of expression with clay, I thought about it in this way: People die and return to soil. The soil becomes the earth and it brings new life. In order to express that, I piled up clay like a Mobius ring and gave it the title &#8220;Rin’ne”, which means a cycle of reincarnation.</p><div id="attachment_15345" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/④Ban-Kazunori01-title-Rin’ne.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Ban Kazunori, Rin&#039;ne" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15345" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15345" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/④Ban-Kazunori01-title-Rin’ne.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15345" class="wp-caption-text">Ban Kazunori, Rin&#8217;ne</p></div><p>After my graduating from university, I entered the Tajimi City Pottery Design and Technical Center.</p><p>I met people who were seriously dealing with the clay, and I re-examined the relationship between myself and the clay.</p><p>In order to show the attractiveness of the clay itself and to make it easier to see the shape, I stopped using glaze and made the work titled &#8220;Gasshou”, which means the palms placed together in prayer. However, I felt something is different. So, I changed my method to more instinctive and impulsive way, because I thought what I wanted to express would get into a form while I am interacting with clay, rather than managing the clay through the intellect. And the work titled &#8220;Kugeki&#8221;, which means void or vacant space was completed. The work expressed a form of reason combined with instinct.</p><div id="attachment_15353" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑤Ban-Kazunori02-title-Gasshou.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Ban Kazunori, Gasshou" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15353" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15353" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑤Ban-Kazunori02-title-Gasshou.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15353" class="wp-caption-text">Ban Kazunori, Gasshou</p></div><div id="attachment_15351" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑥Ban-Kazunori03-title-Kugeki.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-5" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Ban Kazunori, Kugeki" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15351" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15351" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑥Ban-Kazunori03-title-Kugeki.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15351" class="wp-caption-text">Ban Kazunori, Kugeki</p></div><h3>Shioya Ryota</h3><p>I continue to produce works in order to arouse “reality” to every viewer by the “form” consisting of fired clay and by “mechanism” such as natural phenomena and traces of actions occurring in the making process.</p><div id="attachment_15354" style="width: 1061px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑦Shioya-Ryota.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-6" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Shioya Ryota" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15354" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15354" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑦Shioya-Ryota.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15354" class="wp-caption-text">Shioya Ryota</p></div><p><b>Soda Tsukasa</b></p><p>Intersection of light and shadow.</p><p>Dim light rays falling from the clouds</p><p>Shake in the breeze and Sunlight shining through the wood.</p><p>This series is shaping on the concept of the intersection of light and shadow.</p><div id="attachment_15349" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑧Soda-Tsukasa.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-7" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Soda Tsukasa" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15349" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-15349" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑧Soda-Tsukasa.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15349" class="wp-caption-text">Soda Tsukasa</p></div><p><b>Hashimoto Tomonari</b></p><p>By doing quite primitive activities that is making works with clay by hands and fire it, I seek for things invisible but certainly existing or things indicating the existence. For me, the series of actions means the time to get control of myself and reflect on myself. Such a spirit is necessary for our rapidly changing modern world, isn’t it? I hope that my work could give you an opportunity to stop and search for the nature of things, or to face your own inner world.</p><div id="attachment_15352" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑨Hashimoto-Tomoya.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-8" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Hashimoto Tomoya" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15352" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-15352 size-full" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/⑨Hashimoto-Tomoya.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-15352" class="wp-caption-text">Hashimoto Tomonari</p></div><p><b>Jovana Čavorović</b></p><p>The pupa form and theme arise from my contact with traditional Japanese techniques and practices in ceramics.
