To help sustain this precious culture, we’re presenting a novel online event where the product is the story itself.</p><p>With assistance from Indian craft expert <a href="http://garlandmag.com/tag/lokesh-ghai">LOkesh Ghai</a>, we will look at the work of master Warli folk artist Ramesh Hengadi. The stories in his work will be enlivened by expert storyteller <a href="https://tracscotland.org/storytellers/gauri-raje/">Gauri Raje</a>.</p><p>Warli are a tribal people who live as subsistence farmers on the west coast of India. Traditionally, they decorate the ochre walls of their clay huts using rice paste. Their patterns of circle, triangle and square, go back five thousand years. In recent times, their tradition has translated into an art form appreciated by collectors.</p><p>Their paintings reflect stories about nature and mythology. We’ll be including the charming story of the goddess found in the bael fruit, an Indian quince.</p><p>Proceeds from this event will go directly to the performers and help sustain this unique art form during the economic drought that endures in our world.</p><p>Come to see beautiful artworks, learn about folk art today, be enchanted by magical stories and support the survival of this important craft tradition.</p><p>This event will suit adults with a taste for culture as well as their curious children.</p><hr /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20381" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Clipboard-Image-6-1-1024x614.jpg" /><p>&nbsp;</p> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-20267" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/AU3A0043-1024x712.jpg" /><p><a href="https://garlandmag.com/article/warli/">From earth grew rice, from rice grew the Warli art by LOkesh Ghai</a></p><hr /><div id="eventbrite-widget-container-122921031113"></div> <script src="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/static/widgets/eb_widgets.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">var exampleCallback = function() { console.log('Order complete!'); }; window.EBWidgets.createWidget({ // Required widgetType: 'checkout', eventId: '122921031113', iframeContainerId: 'eventbrite-widget-container-122921031113', // Optional iframeContainerHeight: 425, // Widget height in pixels.
