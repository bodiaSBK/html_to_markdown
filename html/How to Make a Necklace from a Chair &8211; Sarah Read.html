<hr><p>One of New Zealand&#8217;s most interesting jewellers, Sarah Read has created a performance practice which explores the value of labour. In this project, she is stringing the polystyrene beads from a bean bag into an epic necklace form. It&#8217;s the kind of challenge you might imagine South Koreans like <a href="http://garlandmag.com/article/the-art-of-polishing-stones/">Yujin Eugénie Moon</a> would appreciate. As automation removes our dependence on human labour, might we see its re-emergence in artistic forms like this?</p><p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium" src="http://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/sarah08.jpg" />Source: <em><a href="https://www.theseehere.com/">The See Here</a></em></p>
