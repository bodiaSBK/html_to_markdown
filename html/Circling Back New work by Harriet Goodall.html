Harriet has always collected haunting relics from these sites and been intrigued by the mysterious energy that lingers when things are abandoned. Soon nature begins to reclaim the elements and the indelible marks of age and decay begin. What remains of us when we leave a place? How long do traces of us remain on the landscape?</p><div id="attachment_14121" style="width: 655px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harriet-Goodall_Circling-Back_with-work.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Harriet Goodall, with Circling Back" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14121" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-14121" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harriet-Goodall_Circling-Back_with-work.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-14121" class="wp-caption-text">Harriet Goodall, with Circling Back</p></div><blockquote><p>I am forever circling back, not just in my dreams, but literally also to collect materials I find by the roadside or in the paddocks. I weave through these fences and burnt out car panels with naturally coloured fibres that mimic the scribbly lines of insects on bark, striations in granite boulders, wending rivers or sheep tracks in dry paddocks. My heart beats for the decay and beauty of inland Australia and this is an elegy for the loss of feeling that I belong there.</p></blockquote><p>Raised in rural Australia, <a href="https://harrietgoodall.com/">Harriet Goodall</a> is a full-time sculptor and basket maker exploring the intersection of traditional craft with contemporary art and design. She has taught regular basketry classes for more than ten years in Australia and internationally and has pieces in private and commercial collections.</p><div id="attachment_14124" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harriet-Goodall_Circling-back-SMALL-1.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Harriet Goodall, Circling back" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14124" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-14124" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Harriet-Goodall_Circling-back-SMALL-1-1024x697.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-14124" class="wp-caption-text">Harriet Goodall, Circling back</p></div><div id="attachment_14123" style="width: 627px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC80912-01.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Harriet Goodall," title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14123" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-14123" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC80912-01.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-14123" class="wp-caption-text">Harriet Goodall,</p></div> <a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC8082-01.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-14122" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/DSC8082-01.jpg" /></a><hr /><p>And some lines from the poem <a href="http://www.lesmurray.org/uncollected_bsf.htm">100</a> (<em>The Boys Who Stole The Funeral)</em> by the recently departed Les Murray:</p><p>She goes to the rust-still, algae-curdled dam<br /> that is level with the garden, allows the bucket sinkage,<br /> watches her daughter and Reeby approach past the feed-shed<br /> and hauls up the bucket, brimming with loose shine and life-chains.</p><hr /><p><em>Circling Back will be at Sturt Cnr Range Rd and Waverley Pde, Mittagong, NSW, Australia, from 9 June to 28 July.</em></p>
