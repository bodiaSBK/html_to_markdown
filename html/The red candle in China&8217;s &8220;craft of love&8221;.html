His wedding was celebrated with great fireworks, filling the skies with smoke and bursts of light. Countless flocks of birds were seen to appear in witness to the event. In reference to this wedding, today young Chinese couples burn red candles on their wedding night. Red symbolises good luck and health, as well as eternal love.</p>
