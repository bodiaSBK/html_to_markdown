This is a dynamic region with many new universities and art schools offering pathways to formalise their creative sectors.</p><p>The peer review section of the quarterly will include academic articles that make an original contribution to the archive of knowledge about creative practice in the material arts. The material arts includes object-based practices such as craft, product design and representational practices such as painting, photography, video and performance that take a concrete form in the world. We welcome submissions arising from postgraduate theses. </p><p>You can find out more about the journal and its submission requirements on the<a href="http://garlandmag.com/journal"> Journal</a> page. </p><p>This initiative is supported by the RMIT University School of Art.</p><p><em>Image taken from Christie&#8217;s <a href="https://www.christies.com/features/Scholars-objects-collecting-guide-7228-1.aspx">Inside the Scholar&#8217;s Studio</a></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
