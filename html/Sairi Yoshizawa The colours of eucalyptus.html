The work is first plain woven fabric however after the fabric is dipped/dyed in one bath the monotonous landscape appears; it is like searching for and recording nuance of colours and patterns in the landscape. The four eucalyptus leaves woven work are all woven with pre-hand natural dyed threads. The work took roughly four months to complete, not every day as she has been working on other projects. Many of her works are works on progress. There was a time gap between completing the bark-dyed and leaf-dyed works. She combined the works together to give more conceptual value by exploring the common grounds of belonging. The material absorbs the substance of everyday life. It explores the inner surface of truth through unique and unpredictable colours of the environment.</p><div id="attachment_14709" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5c78c037c333e-SairiYoshizawaessencedetail1.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14709" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-14709 size-large" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5c78c037c333e-SairiYoshizawaessencedetail1-e1560399704477-1024x532.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-14709" class="wp-caption-text">Sairi Yoshizawa, Essence (detail), Handwoven and natural dyed cotton, wool and stainless steel, 110cm height x 17cm diameter x 3, 110cm height x 8cm diameter x 4</p></div><p style="font-weight: 400;">Sairi weaves her work using three small tablelooms at home, two 4-heddle tablelooms from the university and gift from friend’s sister in law’s in the living room, a 8-heddle tableloom rented from a friend who probably wants it back very soon in her bedroom. She natural dyes her threads in the garage mostly find her materials in local areas, bushland and spice markets.
