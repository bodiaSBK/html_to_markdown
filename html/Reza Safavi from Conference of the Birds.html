Framing.</p><p>This recent work of master Reza Safavi has been performed as a commission of the Cultural Heritage, Handcraft and Tourism Organization in Mashhad. The calligraphy in the centre of work is Sūrat al-Tawḥīd, which refers to the fifth valley of the seven valleys in Attar&#8217;s book (<i>the Conference of Birds</i>). The other ones are the names of the valleys.</p><p>For more information, you can see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conference_of_the_Birds">Conference of Birds</a> in Wikipedia. but, in short, these seven valleys are as follows:  </p><p>1. Valley of the<b> Quest</b>, where the Wayfarer begins by casting aside all dogma, belief, and unbelief.</p><p>2. Valley of <b>Love</b>, where reason is abandoned for the sake of love.</p><p>3. Valley of <b>Knowledge</b>, where worldly knowledge becomes utterly useless.</p><p>4. Valley of <b>Detachment</b>, where all desires and attachments to the world are given up. Here, what is assumed to be “reality” vanishes.</p><p>5. Valley of <b>Unity</b>, where the Wayfarer realizes that everything is connected and that the Beloved is beyond everything, including harmony, multiplicity, and eternity. [ Surat al- Tawhid is the best and the closest concept of this valley]</p><p>6. Valley of <b>Wonderment</b>, where, entranced by the beauty of the Beloved, the Wayfarer becomes perplexed and, steeped in awe, finds that he or she has never known or understood anything.</p><p>7. Valley of <b>Poverty and Annihilation</b>, where the self disappears into the universe and the Wayfarer becomes timeless, existing in both the past and the future.)</p>
