A journey upwards to the light weaves around the history of tile ceramics in the everyday life of Japan. The Tajimi style involves tiny tiles, making a kind of complex pixelation that gives ordinary forms like public bathtubs a stylish look.</p><p>I spoke with the curator Nadoka Murayama who helped develop the museum to its inception a year ago. When I asked her what had surprised her during this time, she said: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect the public would want to touch everything so much.&#8221;</p><p>Indeed, the ground floor is a hive of activity, with special kits for visitors which enables them to make a mosaic on a picture frame. When we exited the building, walking up the gentle hill the flanks the museum, I saw why this was such a popular pursuit. Dozens of visitors were taking images of this photogenic museum (modelled on the original clay mountain of the area) through their handmade picture frames.</p><p>That&#8217;s interesting. To an extent, it performs the function of a selfie in presenting a personal perspective on a public scene. But instead of the phone holder, what &#8220;frames&#8221; the scene is their own handiwork.</p><p>Are we seeing the evolution of a new kind of &#8220;selfie&#8221;, with Japanese characteristics? Would we call it the &#8220;craftie&#8221; in honour of the universal Australian diminutive?We try to be open-minded about the impact of Instagram on what we are producing. On the one hand, it&#8217;s a monumental distraction, frittering away time in a stream of images. But the &#8220;craftie&#8221; shows how it can also be a platform for something a little more productive. </p>
