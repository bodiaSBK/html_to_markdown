So it&#8217;s refreshing to share a story of an artistic collaboration between a Brazilian artist Ernesto Neto and Huni Kuin artist Ibã Sales.</p><p>Ernesto Neto has been working with shamans since a show at Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, in 2014. In 2015, he built a Huni Kuin meeting house for the exhibition “Aru Kuxipa | Secret Sacred” at Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary (TBA 21). His work includes a suspended installation for visitors to walk through which takes the form of a serpent, evoking the boa constrictor and ayahuasca in Huni Kuin cosmology. </p><p>In a recent chapter, Goldstein and Labate describe the scene:</p><blockquote><p>This penetrable space, filled with light colors, with seating on the floor, and the smell of carnations, provided a rich sensory and bodily experience. The gallery took the form of a boa constrictor, with the entrance through its mouth. The fabric hem surrounding the boa was lined with colored bottle tops that made a sound like a seed rattle as people brushed past, like the one suspended in the center of the boa-tent. Colored bottle tops also formed a maraca gourd rattle on a curved marble table on which a bottle of ayahuasca was placed. </p></blockquote><p>Ilana Seltzer Goldstein &amp; Beatriz Caiuby Labate. 2018. <a href="https://www.academia.edu/35989983/From_the_forest_to_the_museum_notes_on_the_artistic_and_spiritual_collaboration_between_Ernesto_Neto_and_the_Huni_Kuin_people">“From the Forest to the Museum: Notes on the Artistic and Spiritual Collaboration between Ernesto Neto and the Huni Kuin.”</a> In <i>The Expanding World.
