It was winter, but we had good weather. I was surprised at how casually he took on big tasks, but I suppose he’s been doing it for a while. He also looks after the farm. The chiselling part of the sculpture was done at his studio closer to the city. I wasn’t there for every chip because the whole process takes days. There something satisfying about the sound and sight of wood being chipped. The finished sculpture was mounted on a slab of concrete back at the farm, where it may still be. It’s not so easy to transport such a heavy object.</p></blockquote><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/298348961?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p><p>Here&#8217;s Mike Nicholls&#8217; description of the work:</p><blockquote><p>The concept behind the image of the gannet resting on an egg, upon a rock, could be interpreted as a gannet resting on the shoulders of a figure. It was developed from a previously commissioned memorial sculpture, with the gannet signifying mourning, nurturing, sleeping, whilst the egg signifies, the rebirth of the next generation. Alternatively, it can be viewed as a totem, a spirit resting, guarding the soul on whose shoulders it rests’ upon. The sculpture is part of my studio practice and will be exhibited in a forthcoming exhibition.</p></blockquote><p>The tree is a cypress pine from Charlie, a tree surgeon based in Hastings, Victoria. </p> <a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4454.jpg" rel="lightbox" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11867" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_4454.jpg" /></a><p>Born in 1960 Mike Nicholls grew up on a dairy farm at Narre Warren North on the outskirts of Melbourne, where he still has a studio-gallery and maintains the family property.
