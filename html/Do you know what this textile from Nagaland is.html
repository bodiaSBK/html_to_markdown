Please note this query about a sash from the Indian north-east state of Nagaland. </p><p>Kelly Grimshaw is a Conservation masters student at the University of Lincoln and is currently working with an object which has been labelled ‘Naga loin cloth’.</p><p>There is little information provided within her department, so she is reaching out to museums to see if there is any information regarding its origins, its use. &#8220;I do not believe it is a loin cloth, but rather a sash, and if it originally belonged to the Naga tribes in Nagaland.&#8221;</p><p>If there are any similar objects within your collection that would support its origin from Nagaland, that would be extremely helpful.</p><p>Please leave a comment below if you have any ideas.</p>
