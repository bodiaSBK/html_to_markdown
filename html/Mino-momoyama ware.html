One of them is <em>Renboshiki Noborigama</em> (linked multi-chamber climbing kiln) and the others are <em>Oh-gama</em> (single-chamber kiln). Most importantly, the <em>Renboshiki Noborigama</em> is the oldest of the kilns in the Mino region and famous as the birthplace of <em>Oribe</em> ware. The original kiln structure is well preserved. Because of its importance in the development of Japanese ceramics, it was designated a National Historical Monument in 1967. Here, your experience of walking around the <em>Motoyashiki</em> kiln site will allow you to deepen your understanding of <em>Oribe</em> ware and the other wares fired in<em> Oh-gama</em> (<em>Setoguro, Kiseto, Shino</em>) as you enjoy yourself in <a href="http://www.toki-bunka.or.jp/oribe"><em>Oribenosato</em> Park.</a></p><div id="attachment_17128" style="width: 838px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Motoyashiki-kiln.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Motoyashiki kiln" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17128" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17128 size-large" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Motoyashiki-kiln-828x1024.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-17128" class="wp-caption-text">Motoyashiki kiln</p></div><h3><strong>Mino-Momoyama Ware</strong></h3><p>During the Momoyama period (sixteenth to seventeenth century), as tea ceremony grew in popularity, Mino ware reflected the taste of tea masters. The ceramic ware of this style made in that period is called <em>Mino-Momoyama</em> ware, of which there are four kinds: <em>Setoguro </em>type<em>, Kiseto </em>type<em>, Shino </em>type and <em>Oribe </em>type.</p><p><em>Setoguro</em>, <em>Kiseto,</em> and <em>Shino</em> appeared in the early Momoyama period and they were generated in <em>Oh-gama</em>．<a href="https://garlandmag.com/loop/setoguro/"><em>Setoguro </em></a>type, means black <em>seto</em> glaze was a special variety of iron glaze．When the tea-bowl with iron graze glowed red in the chamber, it was pulled out of the kiln at peak temperature and cooled rapidly so their color turned to black．The original colour of iron glaze is brown，but this special skill changes the ware dramatically．In the <em>Kiseto </em>type，yellow <em>seto</em> glaze is decorated with ash glaze．Ash was made from plants．While th <em>Setoguro</em> type was used only for tea-bowls，<em>Kiseto</em> type was associated with tea-ceremony party’s table ware, such as dish，bowl，and vase．Next，<em>Shino</em> type with the new white glaze appeared．This was the first white glaze in Japan，and also the initial ceramics decorated by the writing brush．There had been no drawn ceramics in Japan until <em>Shino</em> came out．</p><div id="attachment_17126" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Oribe-Kuro-type.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Oribe Kuro type" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17126" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17126 size-large" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Oribe-Kuro-type-1024x796.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-17126" class="wp-caption-text">Tea bowl, Oribe Kuro type, Motoyashiki kiln</p></div><p><em>The Oribe </em>Type <em>Motoyasiki</em> kiln site was the first <em>Renboshiki Noborigama </em>(linked multi-chamber kiln) introduced to Mino from <em>Karatsu</em>（modern Saga prefecture Japan） in the beginning of the seventeenth century．It has 14 chambers and measures more than 24 meters long．This kiln had stronger heating power than the former kiln <em>Oh-gama</em>．So the Mino potter came to mass-produce ceramics because of this kiln．The ceramics made in this kiln at the Momoyama period was <em>Oribe </em>type．There were many kinds of <em>Oribe</em> type ware produced in <em>Motoyasik</em>i- kiln，for example，<em>Ao</em> <em>oribe</em>，<em>Shino</em> <em>oribe</em>，<em>Aka</em> <em>oribe</em>，<em>Narumi</em> <em>oribe</em>，<em>Kuro</em> <em>oribe</em>，and <em>Oribe</em> <em>kuro</em>．</p><p><em>Ao</em> <em>oribe</em> is quite popular. The name <em>Oribe</em> is associated in many people with this green ceramics covered with copper glaze.<em> Shino oribe</em> is a sort of <em>Shino </em>type fired in the linked multi-chamber kiln．These two ceramics are similar in their form and the colour，but totally different in their tastes．Some people find <em>Shino</em> warm or soft，and feel <em>Shino oribe</em> is cool or hard. <em>Aka oribe</em> is made of red clay  which contains elements of iron．And <em>Narumi oribe</em> is a version of <em>Aka</em> <em>oribe</em> covered with the green glaze．<em>Kuro</em> <em>oribe</em> and <em>Oribe</em> <em>kuro</em> are made by same way of<em> Setoguro</em>．The difference between them is the white form of the body called in Japanese “<em>Mado</em>”, which means the window．<em>Kuro</em> <em>oribe</em> has this white form，but <em>Oribe</em> kuro has no space．Of course they are different from <em>Setoguro</em> due to their warp．In generall, we take these ceramics as “<em>Oribe</em>”</p><div id="attachment_17132" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ao-Oribe-type.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Mukozuke dish,Ao Oribe type, Motoyashiki kiln" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17132" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-17132" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Ao-Oribe-type-1024x683.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-17132" class="wp-caption-text">Mukozuke dish,Ao Oribe type, Motoyashiki kiln</p></div><div id="attachment_17125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kiseto-type.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Kiseto type" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-17125" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-17125 size-large" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kiseto-type-1024x796.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-17125" class="wp-caption-text">Flower vase, Kiseto type, Motoyashiki kiln</p></div><p><em>Mino-Momoyama</em> ware are displayed in <a href="http://www.toki-bunka.or.jp/history">Toki City Historical Museum of Mino Ceramics</a>.
