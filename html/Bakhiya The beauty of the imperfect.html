It also offers a sufi meditation on the beauty of the imperfect and fragility of life, as reflected in these poignant works at Threshold Art Gallery, Delhi.</p><p><em>The curator Tunty Chauhan introduces the exhibition concept:</em></p><p>Kintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken ceramic objects by enhancing the cracks in the ceramic-ware with gold embellishment. Here the gold fissure or scar becomes a testament to a difficult journey, and the marks of wear add value to the object. We find reflections of this deeper philosophy of &#8220;not rejecting the imperfect&#8221; in various other cultural traditions including Sufi.</p><p>The practice of <em>bakhiya</em>, suturing the garment, by the Sufi Darvesh (mendicant) symbolises the meditative activity of not letting things fall apart. Textile traditions of Kantha, Sujani, Rafoo come from a similar philosophy of repurposing rather than discarding. It is a metaphor for embracing flaws and imperfections present in all human existence, where the fragility of life itself becomes its strength.</p><p>Through the works of these artists, the exhibition explores the resilience and tenacity of the human spirit to survive against seemingly insurmountable odds. Serving as a subtle reminder to the viewer to embrace and appreciate all aspects of life and revisit our conception of beauty/desirability, not as the absence of imperfection but rather, by recognizing those very flaws as an inextricable part of what completes us, the fingerprints of life itself.</p><h3>Rubaba Haider</h3><div id="attachment_18035" style="width: 816px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rubaba-Haider-Gouache-on-wasli-paper-28-in-x-22-in_.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Rubaba Haider, the stitch is lost, unless the thread be knotted VIII, gouache on wasli paper, 28 x 22 in, 2017" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18035" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-18035" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Rubaba-Haider-Gouache-on-wasli-paper-28-in-x-22-in_-806x1024.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-18035" class="wp-caption-text">Rubaba Haider, the stitch is lost, unless the thread be knotted VIII, gouache on wasli paper, 28 x 22 in, 2017</p></div><p>To keep darning the cuts and slits in the vestments of memory: How can the heart survive on this alone?

Haider holds a BFA (Miniature Painting) from the National College of Arts, Lahore (2008) and a BA (Criminal Justice with distinction) from RMIT University Melbourne. She works across multiple disciplines from linear drawings to miniature paintings in gouache, to three-dimensional public art projects. Her intention is to redeﬁne traditional Hazaragi techniques of weaving and embroidery through unorthodox, intricate renderings of cloth and thread on paper using gouache and pencil. She chooses to subvert these traditional crafts by incorporating cultural metaphors from everyday life in form of fabrics, threads, knots and needles, to depict the fragility of relationships, and the signiﬁcance of locating and relocating. The fragility in Haider’s works has a melancholic feel to them. Haider’s works have been shown in group exhibitions in Australia and overseas and is held in a number of private collections in Europe, the Subcontinent and Australia.</p><div id="attachment_18029" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bakhiya-At-Threshold-Curated-by-Tunty-Chauhan.-Jan-20_Page_35_Image_0001.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Rubaba Haider, I see my beauty in you (Rumi) III, Gouache and acrylic on wasli paper, 27.5 x 22 in, 2016" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18029" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-18029" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bakhiya-At-Threshold-Curated-by-Tunty-Chauhan.-Jan-20_Page_35_Image_0001.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-18029" class="wp-caption-text">Rubaba Haider, I see my beauty in you (Rumi) III, Gouache and acrylic on wasli paper, 27.5 x 22 in, 2016</p></div><h3>Priya Ravish Mehra</h3><div id="attachment_18031" style="width: 803px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bakhiya-At-Threshold-Curated-by-Tunty-Chauhan.-Jan-20_Page_01.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-4" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="Priya Ravish Mehra, Untitled, Hand-done &#039;rafoogari&#039; (darning) on pashmina cloth, 29 x 19 in, 2017" title=""><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-18031" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-18031" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bakhiya-At-Threshold-Curated-by-Tunty-Chauhan.-Jan-20_Page_01-793x1024.jpg" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-18031" class="wp-caption-text">Priya Ravish Mehra, Untitled, Hand-done &#8216;rafoogari&#8217; (darning) on pashmina cloth, 29 x 19 in, 2017</p></div><p>Priya Ravish Mehra (1961-2018) was a Delhi-based textile artist and weaver, researcher and designer.
