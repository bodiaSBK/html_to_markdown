Emerging from the rainforest canopy and cultures that have spanned generations, the stories and environments of these ancient cultures are transformed into visual designs by weavers, painters, potters, textile artists and makers of traditional objects. </span></p><p><b><a href="http://hermannsburgpotters.com.au">Hermannsburg Potters (NT)</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hermannsburg Potters are a close group of Western Arrernte artists who have worked for the past 35 years in their community of Ntaria. Located in Hermannsburg, 130 kilometres west of Alice Springs, the hand-coiled terracotta pots of these artists are painted with vibrant depictions of their individual and shared histories in their country. Stories and events of the past and present interweave to present narratives characterised by adaptation, social shifts and the Arrernte artists&#8217; keenness to learn and work with the new. </span></p><div id="attachment_12957" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190413_Nishi-Gallery_Ceramics_Rohan-Thomson_Lowres_Installation_-3.jpg" data-rel="lightbox-image-3" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="‘Nintinjaku - Nyuyuntjaku’, ‘Maku Maku’ and ‘Walungurru’ by Ernabella Arts, Rupert Jack and Pepai Jangala Carroll, represented by Ernabella Arts.
