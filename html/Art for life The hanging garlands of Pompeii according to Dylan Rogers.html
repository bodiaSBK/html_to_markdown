It reveals the prevalence of murals, not just as decoration, but as instructions for living. As part of his investigation of &#8220;lived religion&#8221; in Roman times, archeologist <a href="https://dylankrogers.net/">Dylan Rogers</a> uncovered the real purpose of these garlands.</p><blockquote><p>The inclusion of painted garlands on walls is an enduring reminder to individuals and the community that garland-giving is a vital part of the veneration of the deities depicted in that space.</p></blockquote><p>This discovery emphasises the true meaning of garlands as &#8220;living&#8221; objects that help maintain cultural order. This is a challenge for our understanding of art as made of fixed objects that live separate from life in galleries and museums.</p><p>Visit this world of ancient Rome with Dylan Rogers.</p><p><iframe src="https://anchor.fm/garland/embed/episodes/Art-for-life-The-hanging-garlands-of-Pompeii-according-to-Dylan-Rogers-egg56e" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><h3>Reference</h3><p>Rogers, Dylan. 2020. “<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/9/2/65/htm#">The Hanging Garlands of Pompeii: Mimetic Acts of Ancient Lived Religion</a>.” <em>Arts &amp; Health</em> 9 (2): 65.</p>
