As a nation that seeks to revive its traditional culture, how does this parallel the trajectory of nations around the Pacific Rim? We learn from the dragons not only in China but also in Mexico, Australia and India. Do they still have a place in our lives? Does their relation to unpredictable weather help us acknowledge the reality of climate change? Are there other ancient beliefs that may have a renewed relevance today?</p><p>Speakers include:</p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li><a href="https://garlandmag.com/tag/mitraja-bais/">Mitraja Bais</a> &#8211; specialist in Indian craft and culture</li><li>Tyson Yunkaporta &#8211;  Senior Lecturer in Indigenous Knowledges at Deakin University and member of the Apalech clan (west cape)</li><li>Yunuen Perez &#8211; Mexican-born, Melbourne-based production designer and weaver</li><li>Mae Anna Pang &#8211; ex-curator of Asian art, National Gallery of Victoria</li><li><a href="https://www.tammywonghulbert.com/">Tammy Wong Hulbert</a> &#8211; Chinese-Australian artist and lecturer at RMIT University</li></ul></li></ul><hr /><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This event is part of the Victorian Design Program, an initiative of the Victorian Government in collaboration with the NGV.
