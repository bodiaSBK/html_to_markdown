As defined by the sixteenth-century tea master Sen Rikyu (千利休), the goal is to find value in nothingness. For that purpose, the chashitsu (茶室, tea room) could be a wooden shack that consists of nothing more than four-and-a-half tatami mats and decorated with a single flower.</p><p>Kuniji Tsubaki is a Japanese architect who specialises in tea rooms. He has found an ingenious way to take this spirit of hinraku around the world. His chashitsu fits in a suitcase and can be re-assembled in any location where he spreads a message of peace. Kuniji-san&#8217;s portable tea room is constructed by his team of master artisans. </p><p>&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0828_zen-an_中面.jpg" rel="lightbox" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-magnific_type="image" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-11986" src="https://garlandmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0828_zen-an_中面-1024x724.jpg" /></a><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And here he is Paris. </p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crctOh_K1d8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>You can find out more about this project <a href="https://www.chashitsukohbo.jp/en/">here</a>.
