The issue as a whole, Ikiteiru kōgei (living craft), will include stories about ways of crafting that enhance our appreciation of life, particularly in the flows and energies of the natural world.</p><p>One remarkable feature of Japanese culture is the reverence for objects. We see this is in the tea ceremony that involves careful handling and appreciation of all its material components.</p><p>There is a genre of Japanese folktales about objects that acquire a life of their own. According to the myth of tsukumogami, objects can transform into creatures after they&#8217;ve been in continual use for 100 years.</p><p>The Japanese attitude towards objects contrasts with a consumerism that fetishises the new, where objects begin to lose value immediately after purchase.</p><p>But many involved in craft know that some of the most trusted tools have a timeless value. This online exhibition is a space to explore “the stories behind what we make” by acknowledging the lifelong contribution made by those favourite tools we could not make without.</p><p>You are invited to submit two images by 14 December 2018. One is of a finished object and the other is of a tool that helped in its creation which you have been using for a long time. Please include a biography of this tool. You are welcome to submit a video of its use. You can submit the work <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/QZtrYtsPEiujNM9j2">here</a>.</p><p><em>Image</em> <a href="http://yokai.wikia.com/wiki/Tsukumogami"><em>Tsukumogami from Hyakki Yako Emaki.</em></a> </p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOxr94xO5_c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
